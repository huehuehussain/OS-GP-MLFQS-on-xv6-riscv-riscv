# VIVA File Update Summary

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The VIVA_EXPLANATION.txt file has been updated with comprehensive Week 2 implementation details.

## What Was Added

### 1. Week 2 Section (New)
Added complete "WEEK 2: MLFQ SCHEDULER CORE IMPLEMENTATION" section covering:

- Week 2 objectives (7 items)
- Complete queue infrastructure code walkthrough
- All 6 queue management functions with pseudocode and explanations:
  - get_quantum()
  - enqueue()
  - dequeue()
  - dequeue_specific()
  - demote_process()
  - priority_boost()

### 2. Core Implementation Details
- Queue data structures (runqueue struct)
- Process structure extension (queue_next field)
- Scheduler rewrite (complete algorithm with old vs new comparison)
- Time quantum enforcement (clockintr() complete walkthrough)
- Process lifecycle integration (fork, wakeup, exit points)

### 3. Execution Examples
Added detailed example traces showing:
- CPU-bound process lifecycle (demotion from L0 → L1 → L2 → L3)
- I/O-bound process behavior (stays at L0)
- Priority boost at 100 ticks
- Clock interrupt handling

### 4. Key Concepts
- Key invariants (5 correctness invariants)
- Common misconceptions (Q&A format)
- Integration with process lifecycle

### 5. Updated Viva Question Prep
Enhanced "Viva Question Prep" section with 20+ questions:
- What does getprocinfo() do? (Week 1)
- What are the 6 queue functions?
- How does the scheduler work in Week 2?
- Why exponential quanta?
- How are I/O processes different?
- What's priority_boost()?
- What's queue_next pointer?
- How does process lifecycle integrate?
- And 12 more detailed Q&A pairs
